      <p class="mb-4">
        Over the past few weeks, I was experimenting with LinkedIn by creating several accounts with different setups to see which resume formats were more likely to pass LinkedIn filters and reach a hiring manager.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Out of 56 candidates, only 18 appeared directly in my inbox. For the others, I had to manually look in the "Not a Fit" (spam) folder to even find their applications. These candidates receive a rejection letter three days later, likely to not discourage them immediately. But effectively, they're already rejected.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I want to be transparent: I’m sharing a <a href="#" class="text-sky-600 underline">LaTeX formatted resume</a> for those who want the best format, and also a <a href="#" class="text-sky-600 underline">drag-and-drop UI</a> tool for converting resumes to PDF using LaTeX. Both options are open source and free. No signup is needed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Key LinkedIn Resume Filters Discovered</h2>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>The most brutal filter</strong> is if your country is different from the one where the job is located.</li>
        <li>If the job is Hybrid or On-Site, and your location is too far (even within the same country), there's a high chance of being auto-rejected.</li>
        <li>Using a foreign phone number (wrong country code) is another common rejection reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Resume formatting matters.</strong> Some fancy PDF templates or Word files can confuse LinkedIn’s parser. Use simple, clean formatting.</li>
        <li>Avoid keyword stuffing — comma-separated or bullet lists of tech stacks at the bottom no longer help and can trigger spam filters. Instead, naturally embed keywords in your job descriptions. Use <strong>bold text</strong> for emphasis when needed.</li>
      </ul>
